 #### Introduction
Bike sharing systems are new generation of traditional bike rentals where whole process from membership, rental and return 
back has become automatic. Through these systems, user is able to easily rent a bike from a particular position and return 
back at another position. Currently, there are about over 500 bike-sharing programs around the world which is composed of 
over 500 thousands bicycles. Today, there exists great interest in these systems due to their important role in traffic, 
environmental and health issues. 

#### Project Title
project-bike sharing.

#### Problem Statement
Building neural network to predict bike sharing rides.

#### Datasets Description
hour.csv : bike sharing counts aggregated on hourly basis. Records: 17379 hours
 day.csv : bike sharing counts aggregated on daily basis. Records: 731 days
